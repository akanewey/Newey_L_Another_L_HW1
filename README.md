# Newey_L_Another_L_HW1

Hi, My Name is Liam Newey. I was born In British Columbia on August 5th, 2003. I moved to ontario when I was 4 year old. I now live in Georgina ON,CA 

I played hockey throughout the entirity of my childhood but quit once covid hit. I dont really play it anymore, I like to play basketball now and I am teaching myself music beat production currently. 

I decided to come to London for school because I used to play hockey in london for tournaments when I was younger. so I guess a bit of nostalgia brought me here.
