# Brand Newey

Hi, My Name is Liam Newey. I was born In British Columbia And moved to ontario when i was 4 year old. I now live in Georgina ON,CA

I played hockey throughout the entirity of my childhood but quit once covid hit. I dont really play it anymore, I like to play basketball now and i am teaching myself music beat production currently. 

I decided to come to London for school because i used to play hockey in london for tournaments when I was younger. so I guess a bit of nostalgia brought me here.
